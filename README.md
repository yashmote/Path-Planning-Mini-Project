# Path-Planning-Mini-Project
This repository contains Python code for creating a path planning environment with randomly generated obstacles using the Shapely and Matplotlib libraries. The repository uses RRT algorithm to navigate through obstacles.

Every time the code is run, it creates 2 files namely 'obstacle_plot.png' and 'obstacle_grid.npy'. obstacle_grid.npy contains obstacels which are ramdomly formed using random,matplotlib and shapely library



Once you run the code, it will start generating Random nodes and conneting them without intersecting with obstacles. As soon as it reaches the goal it will retrace the path with red color
